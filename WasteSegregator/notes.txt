Based on your waste segregation system that rewards users with phone charging,
you'll need several components to safely charge mobile phones via USB. Here are the recommended modules:

Primary Charging Module
TP4056 USB-C Lithium Battery Charging Module with Protection

Input: 5V via USB or DC jack
Output: 5V/1A USB-A port for phone charging
Built-in protection (overcharge, overdischarge, short circuit)
Easy to integrate with relay control
Cost: ~$3-5
Power Supply Components
5V 3A Power Supply Module

Powers both Arduino and charging circuit
Sufficient current for phone charging (typically 1-2A)
Options: AC-DC converter or USB power supply

Control Component (Already in your code)
Your existing relay setup is perfect:
const int chargingRelayPin = 6; // Pin to control charging module relay

Recommended Circuit Integration

// Enhanced charging control with safety features
void startCharging() {
  // Check if USB device is connected (optional)
  if (digitalRead(usbDetectPin) == HIGH) {
    isCharging = true;
    chargingStartTime = millis();
    digitalWrite(chargingRelayPin, HIGH); // Enable TP4056 module
    
    lcd.clear();
    lcd.print(F("REWARD!"));
    lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
    lcd.print(F("Charging Phone"));
    setLEDs(0, 1, 0);
    
    Serial.println(F("Started 5-minute charging cycle"));
  } else {
    lcd.clear();
    lcd.print(F("Connect USB"));
    lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
    lcd.print(F("Cable First"));
    delay(2000);
  }
}

Additional Components (Optional)
USB Current Sensor Module (INA219) - Monitor charging current
USB Type-A Female Connector - For phone connection
5V Relay Module - Control power to charging circuit
Buck Converter Module - Voltage regulation if needed

Wiring Diagram
Arduino Pin 6 → Relay Control
Relay NO → TP4056 VIN+
Power Supply 5V → Relay Common
TP4056 GND → Common Ground
TP4056 USB-A → Phone charging port

Safety Features to Add
Overcurrent protection
Temperature monitoring
USB connection detection
Charging timeout (already implemented)
The TP4056 module is the most recommended solution as it's specifically
designed for safe USB charging with built-in protections
and works perfectly with your existing relay control system.
